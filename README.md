## Your first backend task for this week:

* 1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the following name format: Blu-training2-firstName-lastName. Once created, please send it to me privately.
* 2. Create a new Java project and use Maven for project management.
* 3. Add the necessary dependencies for using Spring and configure the Spring rest application accordingly.
* 4. Add the necessary dependencies for Hibernate and configure the required settings.
* 5. Create a database connection.
* 6. Create a simple endpoint to test the Spring configuration and ensure it works correctly.
* 7. Test the database connection and confirm that the Hibernate mapping functions correctly.
* 8. You can use any IDE, but I recommend using IntelliJ.
* 9. You may use any database you prefer.


# Task 2:
### Create a RESTful API for managing a simple bookstore application using Spring and Hibernate. The bookstore application should support the following functionalities:
* 1 Create a Book: Implement an endpoint to add a new book to the bookstore database. Each book should have attributes such as title, author, genre, publication year, and price.
* 2 Retrieve All Books: Implement an endpoint to fetch all books from the database and return them as a JSON array.
* 3 Retrieve a Specific Book: Implement an endpoint to retrieve details of a specific book based on its unique identifier ex: book ID.
* 4 Search Books by Title or Author: Implement an endpoint to search for books based on either title or author. Users should be able to specify a keyword and retrieve matching books. ex: Title = Java OCA, author = Oracle.
* 5 Delete a Book: Implement an endpoint to delete a book from the database based on its unique identifier.
* 6 Assuming we have a large number of books, say 1000, how can we allow users to retrieve a subset without affecting performance?

* * 4 and 6
